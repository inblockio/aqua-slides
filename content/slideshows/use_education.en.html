        ## Goal of EMREX
        Prohibit students from manipulating their university degrees
        Prohibiting forgery of new university degrees

        Done by establish a trusted channel between the requesting party and the
        university holding the university degree via a so called NCP (Stands for
        National Contact Point) is a trusted service which will forward personal
        student credentials after receiving permission to do so from the
        student.

        ## Downsides of EMREX
        NCP obsolete risk for the PII Data which is stored their and aggregated from the connected universities. 

        Learn from and work with EMREX
        We can embed / support the EMREX data schema
        NCP can act to verify credentials and govern the trusted-account-key list, this will become obsolete through the maturity of the SSI infrastructure.

        ## AQUA makes EMREX obsolete
        - Student is unable to manipulate or forge documents
        - We have fewer components and easier system 
        - With higher degree of document assurance
        - Trustless: we don't depends on 'not hacking' servers 
        </textarea>

    <section data-markdown>
        ## Stop using EMREX, use AQUA
        - Unnecessary steps are removed
        - Time saved from all involved parties - no NCP / required -
        - Eliminating central components [EMREG]
        - No authorization required of the NCP
        - No sharing of educational credentials outside of university
        - Receiving party can validate the document in seconds

    <section data-markdown>
        ## EMREX Conclusion
        - Process saves overall time and money and reduces risks for the documents to be leaked to third parties due to insecure infrastructure. 
        - Student is empowered as holder and distributor of HIS/HER credentials
        - University acts as trust-authority for the identity claim and as a backup for the credentials
